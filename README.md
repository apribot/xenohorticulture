Lua is making me realize how lazy and coddled I am as a programmer. 
Gone are the days of:
<?php
$variable[1][1][1] = ['wheeee'=>1];
var_dump($variable);

Anyway... An idea for a game was spitballed a while ago and I said, 'why not?'
100% burnt out from being a programmer for a living, using a language I have little experience with, and having minimal artistic skills, this is going to be a long slow ride.
