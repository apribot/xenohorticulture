# xenohorticulture

New to Lua, new to game development, minimal artistic skills, minimal free time.

Code is, and may remain, a chaotic mess. 0 planning when into the implementation.
If I run into performance issues or I manage to stick with this until it's nearing
a playable state, I may very well refactor and optimize.

Right now, we have an astronaut that shoots hearts (only upward), indoor rain, and
the possiblity of endless eastern caves.
